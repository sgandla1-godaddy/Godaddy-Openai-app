# The Opportunity:
ChatGPT has 700M+ weekly active users and handles billions of prompts daily and users increasingly turn to ChatGPT to start, brand, and grow their businesses 

# The Challenge:
Potential GoDaddy customers often ask ChatGPT for help with domains, websites, and branding — but GoDaddy isn’t present in that experience.
